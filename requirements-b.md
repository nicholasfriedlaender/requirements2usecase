The Hospital Patient Management System (HPMS) is designed to help health professionals to manage the care of patients, keep track of their medical records, and ensure smooth hospital operations. The HPMS aims to further improve efficiency in healthcare delivery by monitoring the activities of patients, addressing their emerging medical issues, and providing them with up-to-date information.
HPMS will be utilized by the nurses for direct care, medication administration, and vital sign intake by the patients. They log in at the start of every shift to access and make changes to the patient record. The HPMS will allow the immediate reporting of any change in the patient's condition or alteration of the need for medicine.
Treatment plans, diagnosis, and medication are channeled by the doctors through the HPMS. Any changes in status as reported by the patient shall be notified to them for immediate attention. Doctors can issue urgent care instructions or make current adjustments to treatment plans from the system itself.
HPMS is accessible both from stationary terminals and mobile devices within the premises of the hospital via an easy-to-operate interface for all kinds of users in the medical profession. It easily integrates with the EHR infrastructure of the currently present setup in the hospital, supporting real-time data streams from all compatible medical devices for continuous monitoring and record-keeping.
