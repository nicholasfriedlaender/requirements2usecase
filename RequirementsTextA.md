#Requirements Text A

The Production Line Management System (PLMS) enables a line worker, quality inspector, and production manager to trace the production processes, hold the quality level, and ensure fluent production. The system will trace production activities, solve the problems that emerged, and update statuses in real time for maximally effective operation.
Line workers operate machines, assemble pieces of a product, and generally supervise the production line. At the start of every shift, they log in to the PLMS and update their production in the system. They report any malfunction of a machine or lack of a particular material, which gets passed to the quality inspectors or production managers.
Quality inspectors inspect a product for quality during the production process, checking an item against predetermined quality criteria. Any reported issues pop up on the screen, upon which they perform assessments showing that machines operate within quality boundaries. If an item is below the standard, the inspector is able to stop the line or mark the batch for rework.
Production managers oversee the line workers and quality inspectors and control production scheduling and resource allocation. They receive reports from the line workers and quality inspectors and can revise production schedules when problems or delays arise.
The PLMS is provided on-site by both stationary terminals and mobile devices, with a user-friendly interface, as the system can be used by staff with diverse technical skills. A multilingual interface is supplied to work with international teams. Regarding security, the PLMS integrates with the access control system of the factory and conforms to ISO 27001.
