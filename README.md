# Welcome to Req2UseCase!

This repository supports the study:  
***Leveraging Large Language Models for Use Case Model Generation from Software Requirements***.  

It contains the implementation of the proposed method and the results from the experiment with software engineers.  

## Repository Structure  

### ðŸ“¦ Application ([app](app))  
- **Frontend** â€“ User interface for interacting with the system.  
- **[`serverGPU.py`](app/serverGPU.py)** â€“ Python script running on the GPU server.  
- **[`proxyFile.py`](app/proxyFile.py)** â€“ Proxy logic layer that handles communication between the frontend and the GPU server.  

### ðŸ§¾ Prompts  
- **[`prompts.txt`](prompts.txt)** â€“ Contains all prompts designed and used in the study.  

### ðŸ“‘ Requirements Texts  
- **[`requirements-a.md`](requirements-a.md)** â€“ Requirements Text A.  
- **[`requirements-b.md`](requirements-b.md)** â€“ Requirements Text B.  

### ðŸ“Š Results ([models/results](models/results/))  
- **`llm-approach/`** â€“ Results generated with the LLM-based approach.  
- **`manual-approach/`** â€“ Results created manually by participants.  
- Both subfolders contain the results for every participant.  

### âœ… Ground Truth ([models/ground-truth](models/ground-truth/))  
- Contains the validated ground-truth use case models for both requirements texts.
